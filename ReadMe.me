## background-processing

> BackgroundProcessing is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that provides a single point of entry for other mods, or other PartModules, to perform processing on a vessel when it has been backgrounded - the player has left it and gone back to the Kerbal Science Center, launched another vessel, what have you. It also performs some simplistic resource handling for backgrounded vessels.
